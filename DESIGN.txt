I intend to build a top down scrolling shooter game called "Ninja Wars". The back story is that a ninja gets abducted
by aliens but manages to break free before the flying saucer leaves the planet. They end up on top of a moving train and
the ninja has some obstacles to take cover behind in front of him. He uses these while moving around and throwing ninja stars
at a group of aliens that are also moving around and shooting laser beams at him. After killing all the aliens, the game moves 
into level 2 which is against three alien bosses. These guys are much bigger, faster and stronger than the other aliens. The game makes
use of the left and right arrow keys to move the ninja and the space bar to throw stars. The aliens in the first level will 
all look the same and be arranged in rows while moving in the same direction and shooting at the ninja. The three aliens in the 
second level will not be arranged next to each other, will deal more damage and will be moving faster than the aliens in the 
first level.
