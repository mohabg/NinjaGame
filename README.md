How to play the game: You are only allowed to move left or right, while dodging the bullets shot at you by the aliens, or using your shield to absorb them. Your shield has more health than you, and slowly regenerates when it is damaged. You can
throw ninja stars at the aliens, which take two hits to kill. When the shield is activated, the player can neither move nor throw stars, however. Once all aliens are dead, the alien boss comes out. He throws rocks and orbs simulatenously at the player. The orbs can kill in one hit, unless shielded, and are bigger than the rocks so the player must be careful.
At any point, the player can choose to throw fireballs, using the cheat key, which immediately kills all aliens.

Impressions/Suggestions:
Overall, I liked this assignment and I learned a lot. However, I think that the faculty should do a better job of providing us with resources, since we are learning this essentially on our own.
